# üß† Learning

Welcome to my digital graveyard of coding experiments and questionable life
choices.

## What's This?

This is where I dump code while learning new things. Think of it as my personal
coding diary, except instead of "Dear Diary," it's more like "Dear God, why
doesn't this work?"

## What You'll Find Here

- **Shitty Code‚Ñ¢**: Guaranteed to make senior developers weep
- **Half-finished projects**: Because commitment issues aren't just for
  relationships
- **Copy-pasted Stack Overflow solutions**: With minimal understanding of what
  they actually do
- **Comments like `// TODO: Fix this mess`**: Spoiler alert: I never do
- **Variable names**: Ranging from `x` to `thisVariableNameIsWayTooLongButI
DontCareAnymore`

## Quality Assurance

- ‚úÖ Compiles (sometimes)
- ‚úÖ Crashes gracefully (most of the time)
- ‚úÖ Documentation exists (this README counts, right?)
- ‚ùå Best practices followed
- ‚ùå Code reviews performed
- ‚ùå Any semblance of professional standards

## Disclaimer

If you're here looking for production-ready code, you've made a terrible
mistake. This repository is educational in the sense that it teaches you what
NOT to do.

## License

Do whatever you want with this code. If it breaks your computer, that's on you
for trusting random code from the internet.
